# K-factor
## Anonymized calculation of K-factors for a fictitious faculty with members active on Twitter

This notebook contains calculations of the [K-index](https://theinformationalturn.net/kardashian-index/) for faculty using their Google scholar citations and their Twitter following. The notebook performs calculations on a `.csv` file that can be updated with names of faculty members in a unit and actual data.

Data must currently be entered manually and periodically. It would be nice to develop scheduled webscraping to do this job, but I do not have the time at the moment to invest in this. I encourage others to help out!

The Kardashian index holds a negative connotation: not many academics conspire to be as ambitious without substance as the Kardashians. However, most academics engage in platforms like Twitter to increase their reach. In that respect, a social media impact that is greater than an arbitrary metric threshold should be considered excellent.
